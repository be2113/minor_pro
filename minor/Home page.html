              <p> Students constitute a vast segment of Indiaï¿½s population.
                  <br>They are young and dynamic. They can play a major role in various developmental activities going on in the country. 
                  This can come about only if their energies are channelised properly..<br/>
                  To say that education is your doorway to success would be an understatement.
                  It serves as the key which will unlock numerous doors that will lead to success.
                  This will, in turn, help you build a better life for yourself.
                  An educated person has a lot of job opportunities waiting for them on the other side of the door.
                  They can choose from a variety of options and not be obligated to do something they dislike.<br>
                   Most importantly, education impacts our perception positively.
                   It helps us choose the right path and look at things from various viewpoints rather than just one.
